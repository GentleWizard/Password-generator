<h1>Password Generator</h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To use the password generator, simply run the script in a Python environment. The script will prompt the user to specify the length of the desired password and the character types to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and/or numbers).</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>This script requires Python 3.x to run.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>The script uses the `random` and `string` modules to randomly select characters from the available options and join them together to form the password. The user can specify which character types to include by responding to prompts with 'y' or 'n'.</p>

<p>If the user inputs an invalid response, the script will prompt the user to input a valid response.</p>

<p>Once the password is generated, it will be printed to the console. The user can then press enter to exit the script.</p>
